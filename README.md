# Student-Portal
A webpage that shows how a simple student portal looks like ! Would like to develop this webpage using basic semantic tags of HTML such as article,table and form. 
<p> As part of our curriculum, a subject called "Web Technology" where we supposed to do assignments of creating a web page. There I come up with an idea of making a simple Student portal and here that is !</p>
</br>
<p> For this, I have decided to develop a web page that has data of the student where
  * 1. A Student can view their internal marks if that is already updated.
  * 2. A Student can fill the form to register for their upcoming online exams.
  * 2. Also a IT background student can prefer the below link to have a study for their exams.
</br>
<h3> HTML tags used to create this WEBPAGE </h3>
 <h4> SEMANTIC TAGS </h4>
 <p> A Semantic element describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of Semantic tags are Form, Table and Article tags. Have also used Anchor tags and hyper link tags for the students to get their study materials for their preparartions of their exams. </p>
 <h2> HAPPY LEARNING ! </h2>
